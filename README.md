# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.



The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# Book Finder

A simple React application to search for books by title using the Open Library API. This app provides quick, visual search results with book covers, authors, and publish years.

## Features

- Search books by title using Open Library public API (no authentication required).
- Paginated results with "Load More" button.
- Responsive and clean UI using plain CSS.
- Error handling for empty input and network failures.
- Displays book cover, title, author(s), publish year, description, and subjects inline.
- No popup modals—details shown directly in result cards.

## Technologies Used

- React (with hooks)
- Plain CSS for styling
- Open Library API for book data
- Create React App for build tooling and project scaffolding

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed

### Installation

1. Clone the repo:
2. Change to project directory:
3. Install dependencies:



The build is optimized and ready to be deployed.

## Deployment

The app is deployed live at: https://bookfindervijay.netlify.app/

You can deploy the production `build` folder to hosting services like Netlify, Vercel, or GitHub Pages.

## Folder Structure Overview

- `src/` — React source files and components.
- `public/` — Public assets, HTML template, manifest, favicon.
- `README.md` — This documentation.
- `package.json` — Project dependencies and scripts.

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter build errors related to minification, check React docs for troubleshooting [here](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/troubleshooting#npm-run-build-fails-to-minify).
- Ensure network connectivity for fetching data from Open Library API.
